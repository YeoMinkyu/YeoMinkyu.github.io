### Listing state up by example

```
import { useState } from 'react';

function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About">
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology">
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```

- To coordinate these two panels, you need to “lift their state up” to a parent component in three steps:
  1. **Remove** state from the child components.
  2. **Pass** hardcoded data from the common parent.
  3. **Add** state to the common parent and pass it down together with the event handlers.


    ### Step 1: Remove state from the child components

    - You will give control of the `Panel`’s `isActive` to its parent component. This means that the parent component will pass `isActive` to `Panel` as a prop instead. Start by removing this line from the `Panel` component:
    ```
    const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
    ```

    - And instead, add isActive to the Panel’s list of props:
    
    ```
    function Panel({ title, children, isActive })
    ```
    - Now the `Panel`’s parent component can control `isActive` by passing it down as a prop.


    ### Step 2: Pass hardcoded data from the common parent

    ```
    import { useState } from 'react';

    export default function Accordion() {
    return (
        <>
        <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
        <Panel title="About" isActive={true}>
            With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
        </Panel>
        <Panel title="Etymology" isActive={true}>
            The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
        </Panel>
        </>
    );
    }
    ```

    - Try editing the hardcoded `isActive` values in the `Accordion` component and see the result on the screen.


    ### Step 3: Add state to the common parent

    - Lifting state up often changes the nature of what you’re storing as state.
    - In this case, only one panel should be active at a time. This means that the `Accordion` common parent component needs to keep track of which panel is the active one. Instead of a boolean value, it could use a number as the index of the active `Panel` for the state variable:

    ```
    const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
    ```
    - When the `activeIndex` is `0`, the first panel is active, and when it’s `1`, it’s the second one.
    - Clicking the “Show” button in either `Panel` needs to change the active index in `Accordion`. A `Panel` can’t set the `activeIndex` state directly because it’s defined inside the `Accordion`. The `Accordion` component needs to explicitly allow the `Panel` component to change its state by passing an event handler down as a prop:

    ```
    <>
        <Panel
            isActive={activeIndex === 0}
            onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
        >
            ...
        </Panel>
        <Panel
            isActive={activeIndex === 1}
            onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
        >
            ...
        </Panel>
    </>
    ```

    - The `<button>` inside the `Panel` will now use the `onShow` prop as its click event handler:
    
    ```
    import { useState } from 'react';

    export default function Accordion() {
    const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
    return (
        <>
            <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
            <Panel
                title="About"
                isActive={activeIndex === 0}
                onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
            >
                With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
            </Panel>
            <Panel
                title="Etymology"
                isActive={activeIndex === 1}
                onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
            >
                The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
            </Panel>
        </>
        );
    }

    function Panel({
        title,
        children,
        isActive,
        onShow
    }) {
    return (
        <section className="panel">
            <h3>{title}</h3>
            {isActive ? (
                <p>{children}</p>
            ) : (
                <button onClick={onShow}>
                Show
                </button>
            )}
        </section>
      );
    }
    ```

    ![sharing state parent](/images/sharing_state_parent.webp)
    - Initially, `Accordion`’s `activeIndex` is `0`, so the first `Panel` receives `isActive = true`

    ![sharing state parent clicked](/images/sharing_state_parent_clicked.webp)
    - When `Accordion`’s `activeIndex` state changes to `1`, the second `Panel` receives `isActive = true` instead



### A single source of truth for each state

- **For each unique piece of state, you will choose the component that “owns” it.** This principle is also known as having a “single source of truth”. It doesn’t mean that all state lives in one place—but that for each piece of state, there is a specific component that holds that piece of information. Instead of duplicating shared state between components, lift it up to their common shared parent, and pass it down to the children that need it.
