### SQL
- Structured Query Language is a programming language that allows us to update and query databases.

**Databases**
- When using SQL, we’ll work with a relational database where we can find all of our data stored in a number of tables.
- Each of these tables is made up of a set number of columns and a flexible number of rows.

**[Relational database](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-relational-database/#:~:text=A%20relational%20database%20is%20a,of%20representing%20data%20in%20tables.)**
-  Is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. 
- Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.
- Each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key.
- The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

### Joining Tables
- Many databases in practice are populated by a number of tables that all relate to each other in some way. 

**Foreign keys**
- A ***FOREIGN KEY*** is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

**Inner Join**
- The ***INNER JOIN*** keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
