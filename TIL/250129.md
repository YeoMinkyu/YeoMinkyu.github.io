## Understading of a component

### Common scenarios when a componment unmounts

1. Component is conditionally removed
   - when conditional rendering no longer includes the comoponent

   ```javascript
    {showComponent && <MyComponent />}
   ```

2. Route changes(in SPA)
   - When using routing(like React Router), changing route can cause some components to be removed from the DOM

3. Parents component unmounts
   - if a parent component is removed, all of its child components are also unmounted

4. List udpates
   - When an item is removed from a list that is being mapped over in React

   ```javascript
    {items.map(item => (
        <ItemComponent key={item.id} item={item} />
    ))}
   ```

5. StringMode remount behavior(React 18+)
   - In development mode with `React.StrictMode`, React may unmount and remount components to detect side effects

### What happens when a component unmounts

- When a component unmounts, the **cleanup function** inside the `useEffect` hook is excuted

```javascript
    ...
    
    window.addEventListener("popstate", handlePopState);
    handlePopState();

    ...

     return () => {
        window.removeEventListener("popstate", handlePopState);
    };
```

### How the cleanup function works

- When the component mounts, the effects:
  - Add a `popstate` event listener
  - Initialize the component's states based on the current URL
- When the component unmounts, the effects:
  - Run the `return () => {...}` call back inside `useEffect`
  - Remove the event listener using:
  ```javascript
     window.removeEventListener("popstate", handlePopState);
  ```
  - This prevents **memory leaks** by ensuring that the event listeners don't persist after the component is gone


### Why is cleanup important

- **Prevent momory leaks**
- **Avoid unexpected behavior**
- **Performance optimization**


## Two common ways to define funtion in JavaScript

### 1. Function declaration(Using `function` keyword)

```javascript
function navigate(path) {
    const newView = path.startsWith("/following") ? "following" : 
                    path.startsWith("/profile") ? "profile" : "all";

    setCurrentView(newView); // Update state before triggering a fetch
    window.history.pushState({}, "", path);

    // Trigger popstate manually
    const popStateEvent = new PopStateEvent("popstate");
    dispatchEvent(popStateEvent);
}
```

### 2. Function expression(Using Arrow function)

```javascript
function navigate(path) {
    const newView = path.startsWith("/following") ? "following" : 
                    path.startsWith("/profile") ? "profile" : "all";

    setCurrentView(newView); // Update state before triggering a fetch
    window.history.pushState({}, "", path);

    // Trigger popstate manually
    const popStateEvent = new PopStateEvent("popstate");
    dispatchEvent(popStateEvent);
}
```

### Detailed explanation of differences

1. Hoisting
   - Function declarations are hoisted. They can be used function before they are defined
   - Function expressiosn are not hoisted.
   - Example:
   ```javascript
      sayHello(); // Works with function declaration

      function sayHello() {
         console.log("Hello!");
      }

      greet(); // Error: Cannot access 'greet' before initialization

      const greet = () => {
         console.log("Hi!");
      }
   ```

2. `this` Binding(***important in React***)
   - Function declarations have a dynamic `this` binding, meaning the value of `this` depends on how the fucntion is called 
   - Arrow functions have a lexcial `this`,meaning they inheried `this` from the surrounding scope

3. Implicit return in Arrow function
   - Arrow functions allow for an **implict return**, meaning if there is no `{}`, the value is automatically returned
   ```javascript
      const add = (a, b) => a + b;  // Implicit return
   ```

4. Usage in React functional components
   - Arrow functions are prefered in moder React projects, for defining events handlers and callbacks within functional components
   - Function declarations are more common in utility functions and helper files
   - Example in React:
   ```javascript
      // Using arrow function inside a functional component
      const MyComponent = () => {
         const handleClick = () => {
            console.log("Clicked!");
         };

         return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
      };
   ```


## What is `this` in JavaScript

- `this` refers to the object that calls or owns the function. However its value depends on **how** and **where** the function is called.
Think of `this` as a reference to the current context(or owner) of the function being excuted

### 1. Calling object(Dynamic `this` in function declarations)
    
- A calling object is the object that calls a function. If the functions is a regular declaration, the value of `this` is determined by how the function is called
- Example:

```javascript
   function showThis() {
      console.log(this);
   }

   const user = {
      name: "Alice",
      show: showThis
   };

   user.show(); // 'this' refers to the `user` object
```
### Explanation

- When calling `user.show()`, the function `showThis` runs inside the `user` object
- Therefore inside `showThis()`, `this` referes to the `user` object because it called the function

### Important behavior
- If a function is called without an object, `this` refers to the global object (window in browsers)
- If called inside **strict mode**, `this` is `undefined`

### 2. Enclosing scope(Lexical `this` in arrow functions)

- An enclosing scope refers to the surrounding context in which an arrow function is defined. Unlike a regular function, the arrow function doesn't have their own `this`. Instead, it inherits `this` from the scope in which the arrow functions was created.
- Example:
  ```javascript
   const user = {
      name: "Alice",
      show: () => {
         console.log(this);
      }
   };

   user.show(); // 'this' refers to the surrounding scope, likely the global object (window)
  ```

### Explaination

- The arrow function `show()` does not have its own `this`.
- Instead, it takes `this` from where the function was defined, which in this case is the global scope.


### 3. Practical Example in React

- Example Without Arrow Function (Causes this Issues):

```javascript
   class App extends React.Component {
    handleClick() {
        console.log(this);  // 'this' is undefined if not bound
    }

    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
    }
   }
```

- The function `handleClick()` will not work correctly because `this` is `undefined` when the button is clicked.
- Since it's not called directly from an instance of `App` but by the browser's event system, `this` does not automatically point to the instance of `App`.
