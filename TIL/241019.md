## Extracting State Logic into a Reducer

### Consolidate state logic with a reducer

```
import { useState } from 'react';
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks);

  function handleAddTask(text) {
    setTasks([
      ...tasks,
      {
        id: nextId++,
        text: text,
        done: false,
      },
    ]);
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task) {
    setTasks(
      tasks.map((t) => {
        if (t.id === task.id) {
          return task;
        } else {
          return t;
        }
      })
    );
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
    setTasks(tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== taskId));
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>
      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />
    </>
  );
}

let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},
  {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false},
  {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false},
];
```

- Each of its event handlers calls `setTasks` in order to update the state.
-  To reduce this complexity and keep all your logic in one easy-to-access place, you can move that state logic into a single function outside your component, **called a “reducer”.**
- Reducers are a different way to handle state. You can migrate from `useState` to `useReducer` in three steps:
  1. **Move** from setting state to dispatching actions.
  2. **Write** a reducer function.
  3. **Use** the reducer from your component.


### Step 1: Move from setting state to dispatching actions

- Remove all the state setting logic. What you are left with are three event handlers:
  - `handleAddTask(text)` is called when the user presses “Add”.
  - `handleChangeTask(task)` is called when the user toggles a task or presses “Save”.
  - `handleDeleteTask(taskId)` is called when the user presses “Delete”.

- Instead of telling React “what to do” by setting state, you specify “**what the user just did**” by **dispatching “actions” from your event handlers**. So instead of “setting `tasks`” via an event handler, you’re dispatching an “added/changed/deleted a task” action. This is more descriptive of the user’s intent.

```
function handleAddTask(text) {
  dispatch({
    type: 'added',
    id: nextId++,
    text: text,
  });
}

function handleChangeTask(task) {
  dispatch({
    type: 'changed',
    task: task,
  });
}

function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
  dispatch({
    type: 'deleted',
    id: taskId,
  });
}
```

- The object you pass to dispatch is called an “action”:

```
function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
  dispatch(
    // "action" object:
    {
      type: 'deleted',
      id: taskId,
    }
  );
}
```

- It is a regular JavaScript object. You decide what to put in it, but generally it should contain the minimal information about what happened.

> [!NOTE]
> An action object can have any shape.
> By convention, it is common to give it a string `type` that describes what happened, and pass any additional information in other fields. The `type` is specific to a component, so in this example either '`added`' or '`added_task`' would be fine. Choose a name that says what happened!
```
dispatch({
  // specific to component
  type: 'what_happened',
  // other fields go here
});
```


### Step 2: Write a reducer function

- A reducer function is where you will put your state logic. It takes two arguments, the current state and the action object, and it returns the next state:

```
function yourReducer(state, action) {
  // return next state for React to set
}
```

- React will set the state to what you return from the reducer.
- To move your state setting logic from your event handlers to a reducer function in this example, you will:
  1. Declare the current state (`tasks`) as the first argument.
  2. Declare the `action` object as the second argument.
  3. Return the _next_ state from the reducer (which React will set the state to).

- Here is all the state setting logic migrated to a reducer function:

```
function tasksReducer(tasks, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      return [
        ...tasks,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          done: false,
        },
      ];
    }
    case 'changed': {
      return tasks.map((t) => {
        if (t.id === action.task.id) {
          return action.task;
        } else {
          return t;
        }
      });
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}
```

- Because the reducer function takes state (`tasks`) as an argument, **you can declare it outside of your component**. This decreases the indentation level and can make your code easier to read.
- It’s a convention to use switch statements inside reducers. It can be easier to read switch statements at a glance.
- We recommend wrapping each `case` block into the `{` and `}` curly braces so that variables declared inside of different `case`s don’t clash with each other. Also, a case should usually end with a `return`. If you forget to `return`, the code will “**fall through**” to the next `case`, which can lead to mistakes!


### Step 3: Use the reducer from your component

- Import the `useReducer` Hook from React:
```
import { useReducer } from 'react';
```

- Then you can replace `useState`:
```
const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks);
```

- with `useReducer` like so:
```
const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);
```

- The `useReducer` Hook is similar to `useState` —you must pass it an initial state and it returns a stateful value and a way to set state (in this case, the dispatch function). But it’s a little different.

- The `useReducer` Hook takes two arguments:
  1. A reducer function
  2. An initial state

- And it returns:
  1. A stateful value
  2. A dispatch function (to “dispatch” user actions to the reducer)

```
import { useReducer } from 'react';
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);

  function handleAddTask(text) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'added',
      id: nextId++,
      text: text,
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed',
      task: task,
    });
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'deleted',
      id: taskId,
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>
      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />
    </>
  );
}

function tasksReducer(tasks, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      return [
        ...tasks,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          done: false,
        },
      ];
    }
    case 'changed': {
      return tasks.map((t) => {
        if (t.id === action.task.id) {
          return action.task;
        } else {
          return t;
        }
      });
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}

let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},
  {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false},
  {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false},
];
```


### Comparing 'useState' and 'useReducer'

- **Code size**: Generally, with `useState` you have to write less code upfront. With `useReducer`, you have to write both a reducer function and dispatch actions. However, `useReducer` can help cut down on the code if many event handlers modify state in a similar way.
- **Readability**: `useState` is very easy to read when the state updates are simple. When they get more complex, they can bloat your component’s code and make it difficult to scan. In this case, `useReducer` lets you cleanly separate the how of update logic from the what happened of event handlers.
- **Debugging**: When you have a bug with `useState`, it can be difficult to tell where the state was set incorrectly, and why. With `useReducer`, you can add a console log into your reducer to see every state update, and why it happened (due to which action). If each action is correct, you’ll know that the mistake is in the reducer logic itself. However, you have to step through more code than with `useState`.
- **Testing**: A reducer is a pure function that doesn’t depend on your component. This means that you can export and test it separately in isolation. While generally it’s best to test components in a more realistic environment, for complex state update logic it can be useful to assert that your reducer returns a particular state for a particular initial state and action.
- **Personal preference**: Some people like reducers, others don’t. That’s okay. It’s a matter of preference. You can always convert between `useState` and `useReducer` back and forth: they are equivalent!


### Write reducers well

- Keep these two tips in mind when writing reducers:
  - ***Reducers must be pure***. Similar to state updater functions, reducers run during rendering! (Actions are queued until the next render.) This means that reducers must be pure—same inputs always result in the same output. They should not send requests, schedule timeouts, or perform any side effects (operations that impact things outside the component). They should update objects and arrays without mutations.
  - ***Each action describes a single user interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in the data***. For example, if a user presses “Reset” on a form with five fields managed by a reducer, it makes more sense to dispatch one `reset_form` action rather than five separate `set_field` actions. If you log every action in a reducer, that log should be clear enough for you to reconstruct what interactions or responses happened in what order. This helps with debugging!


## Writing concise reducers with Immer

```
import { useImmerReducer } from 'use-immer';
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

function tasksReducer(draft, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      draft.push({
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        done: false,
      });
      break;
    }
    case 'changed': {
      const index = draft.findIndex((t) => t.id === action.task.id);
      draft[index] = action.task;
      break;
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return draft.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useImmerReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);

  function handleAddTask(text) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'added',
      id: nextId++,
      text: text,
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed',
      task: task,
    });
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'deleted',
      id: taskId,
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>
      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />
    </>
  );
}

let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},
  {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false},
  {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false},
];
```
