### `value_lists(*fields, flat=False, named=False)`

- This is similar to `values()` except that instead of returning dictionaries, it returns tuples when iterated over.Each tuple contains the value from the respective field or expression passed into the `values_list()` call â€” so the first item is the first field, etc.

```python
following_ids = user.follower.values_list("following_user__id", flat=True)
```

- This reduces memory usage and avoids loading full objects into memory, leveraging the database for efficiency.
- `following_user__id`: Here, it's likely that each follower relationship stores the ID of the user that is being followed under the field `following_user`. The double underscore (`__`) is used to access fields of related models (`following_user` is the related `User` model and id is its ID field).
- `flat=True`:  This argument flattens the list, so instead of getting a list of tuples, you get a flat list of IDs. For example, without `flat=True`, you might get `[(1,), (2,), (3,)]`. With `flat=True`, you get `[1, 2, 3]`.

```python
return Post.objects.filter(poster__id__in=following_ids).order_by("-date_created")
```

- `.filter(poster__id__in=following_ids)`: This filters the posts to include only those where the `poster`'s `id` is in the `following_ids` list. It's using the `__in` lookup to filter `posts` whose poster attribute (a foreign key to the `User` model, assumed by the use of id) matches any ID in the list `following_ids`.
- Used `poster__id__in` instead of `poster__in` where possible to filter by ID directly, which can be slightly more performant.
