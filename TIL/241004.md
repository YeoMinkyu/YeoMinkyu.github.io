## Managing State

## Reacting to Input with State

### How declarative UI compares to imperative

- In React, you don’t directly manipulate the UI—meaning you don’t enable, disable, show, or hide components directly. Instead, you ***declare what you want to show***, and React figures out how to update the UI.


### Think about UI declaratively

1. **Identify** your component's different visual states
2. **Determine** what triggers those state changes
3. **Represent** the state in memory using `useState`
4. **Remove** any non-essential state variables
5. **Connect** the event handlers to set the state


### Step1: Identify your component's different visual states

- First, you need to visualize all the different “states” of the UI the user might see:
  - **Empty**: Form has a disabled “Submit” button.
  - **Typing**: Form has an enabled “Submit” button.
  - **Submitting**: Form is completely disabled. Spinner is shown.
  - **Success**: “Thank you” message is shown instead of a form.
  - **Error**: Same as Typing state, but with an extra error message.


### Step2: Determine what triggers those state changes

- You can trigger state updates in response to two kinds of inputs:
  - **Human inputs**, like clicking a button, typing in a field, navigating a link.
  - **Computer inputs**, like a network response arriving, a timeout completing, an image loading.
- In both cases, **you must set state variables to update the UI**.
- For the form you’re developing, you will need to change state in response to a few different inputs:
  - **Changing the text input** (human) should switch it from the Empty state to the Typing state or back, depending on whether the text box is empty or not.
  - **Clicking the Submit button** (human) should switch it to the Submitting state.
  - **Successful network response** (computer) should switch it to the Success state.
  - **Failed network response** (computer) should switch it to the Error state with the matching error message.

### Step 3: Represent the state in memory with useState 

- Next you’ll need to represent the visual states of your component in memory with `useState`. Simplicity is key.

- Start with the state that absolutely must be there. For example, you’ll need to store the answer for the input, and the error (if it exists) to store the last error:

```
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
const [error, setError] = useState(null);
```


### Step 4: Remove any non-essential state variables


- 
- Your goal is to ***prevent the cases where the state in memory doesn’t represent any valid UI that you’d want a user to see***. (For example, you never want to show an error message and disable the input at the same time, or the user won’t be able to correct the error!)

```
const [isEmpty, setIsEmpty] = useState(true);
const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false);
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);
const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false);
```
- Here are some questions you can ask about your state variables:
  - **Does this state cause a paradox?** For example, `isTyping` and `isSubmitting` can’t both be true. A paradox usually means that the state is not constrained enough. There are four possible combinations of two booleans, but only three correspond to valid states. To remove the “impossible” state, you can combine these into a `status` that must be one of three values: '`typing`', '`submitting`', or '`success`'.
  - **Is the same information available in another state variable already?** Another paradox: `isEmpty` and `isTyping` can’t be `true` at the same time. By making them separate state variables, you risk them going out of sync and causing bugs. Fortunately, you can remove `isEmpty` and instead check `answer.length === 0`.
  - **Can you get the same information from the inverse of another state variable?** `isError` is not needed because you can check `error !== null` instead.

```
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
const [error, setError] = useState(null);
const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing'); // 'typing', 'submitting', or 'success'
```


### Step 5: Connect the event handlers to set state

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing');

  if (status === 'success') {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>
  }

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setStatus('submitting');
    try {
      await submitForm(answer);
      setStatus('success');
    } catch (err) {
      setStatus('typing');
      setError(err);
    }
  }

  function handleTextareaChange(e) {
    setAnswer(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>City quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <textarea
          value={answer}
          onChange={handleTextareaChange}
          disabled={status === 'submitting'}
        />
        <br />
        <button disabled={
          answer.length === 0 ||
          status === 'submitting'
        }>
          Submit
        </button>
        {error !== null &&
          <p className="Error">
            {error.message}
          </p>
        }
      </form>
    </>
  );
}

function submitForm(answer) {
  // Pretend it's hitting the network.
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let shouldError = answer.toLowerCase() !== 'lima'
      if (shouldError) {
        reject(new Error('Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!'));
      } else {
        resolve();
      }
    }, 1500);
  });
}
```

-  Expressing all interactions as state changes lets you later introduce new visual states without breaking existing ones. It also lets you change what should be displayed in each state without changing the logic of the interaction itself.
