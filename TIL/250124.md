## Understanding `async/await`

### What is `async/await`?

- `async/await` is a modern way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
- It makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, which improves readability and reduces callback nesting (also known as "callback hell").
- Introduced in **ES2017**, it provides a cleaner syntax compared to traditional **Promises**.


### How it works:

1. `async` Function:
   - Declaring a function with `async` makes it always return a promise.
Inside an `async` function, you can use `await` to pause execution until a promise is resolved.

2. `await` Keyword:
   - `await` pauses the execution of the function until the Promise resolves.
   - It works only inside `async` functions.

### Advantages of using `async/await`

1. Better Readability
   - The code looks more like synchronous code (top-to-bottom flow), making it easier to follow.
2. Error Handling with try-catch
   - We can use standard try-catch blocks instead of chaining .catch().
3. Easier Debugging
   - Stack traces are easier to follow, and stepping through async code in dev tools is more intuitive.
4. No Callback Hell
   - Avoids nesting issues and makes the code more maintainable.


## Understanding `try-catch` in JavaScript

### What is `try-catch`?

- A structed way to handle runtime errors
- The code inside the `try` block is executed, and if an error occurs, the execution is passed to the `catch` block.
- Commonly used to handle errors in asynchronous operations or unexpected situations.


### Syntax of `try-catch`

```javascript
try {
    // Code that might throw an error
    let result = riskyOperation();
    console.log("Result:", result);
} catch (error) {
    // Handles errors thrown in the try block
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
} finally {
    console.log("This will always run, regardless of an error.");
}

```

### Why use `try-catch`

- Provides a centralized way to handle errors instead of spreading .`catch()` across the code.
- Prevents the app from crashing by handling unexpected errors gracefully.
- Allows logging and user-friendly error messages.
