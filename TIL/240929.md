## State: A Component's Memory

### When a regular varibale isn't enough

```
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  let index = 0;

  function handleClick() {
    index = index + 1;
  }
  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

1. **Local variables don’t persist between renders**. When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables.
2. **Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders**. React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.

- To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:
  1. **Retain** the data between renders.
  2. **Trigger** React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).

- The `useState` Hook provides those two things:
  1. A **state variable** to retain the data between renders.
  2. A **state setter function** to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.


### Adding a state variable

- To add a state variable
```
import {useState} from 'react';
```
- at the top of the file.

```
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

- `index` is a state variable and `setIndex` is the setter function.
-  The array returned by `useState` always has exactly two items.

    ### Meet your first Hook

    - In React, `useState`, as well as any other function starting with `use`, is called a **Hook**.
    - ***Hooks*** are special functions that are only available while React is rendering

    > [!NOTE]
    > Hooks—functions starting with use—can only be called at the top level of your components or your own Hooks. You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. You `use` React features at the top of your component similar to how you `import` modules at the top of your file.


    ### Anatomy of `useState`

    - When you call `useState`, you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:

    ```
    const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
    ```

    - In this case, you want React to remember `index`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The convention is to name this pair like `const [something, setSomething]`.

    - The only argument to `useState` is the ***initial value*** of your state variable. In this example, the `index`’s initial value is set to `0` with `useState(0)`.

    - Every time your component renders, useState gives you an array containing two values:
      1. The ***state variable*** (`index`) with the value you stored.
      2. The ***state setter function*** (`setIndex`) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.

    - Here’s how that happens in action:
    ```
    const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
    ```

    1. Your component renders the first time. Because you passed `0` to `useState` as the initial value for `index`, it will return `[0, setIndex]`. React remembers `0` is the latest state value.
    2. You update the state. When ***a user clicks the button***, it calls `setIndex(index + 1)`. `index` is `0`, so it’s `setIndex(1)`. This tells React to remember `index` is `1` now and ***triggers another render***.
    3. Your component’s second render. React still sees `useState(0)`, but because React remembers that you set `index` to `1`, it returns `[1, setIndex]` instead.


### Giving a component multiple state variables

- You can have as many state variables of as many types as you like in one component. This component has two state variables, a number `index` and a boolean `showMore` that’s toggled when you click “Show details”:

```
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```


### State is isolated and private

- State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, ***if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!***
- Unlike props, ***state is fully private to the component declaring it***.
