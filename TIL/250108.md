### Understanding the Dependency Array in `useEffect`

- The dependency array in a `React.useEffect` hook specifies the values that the effect depends on. ***When any of these values change, the effect will re-run.***
- If the dependency array is empty (`[]`), the effect will only run once when the component mounts and will not re-run on subsequent updates.

### When the Dependency Array is useful

- The dependency array is useful when:

   1. The effect relies on specific state or props values.
   2. You want the effect to re-run whenever those specific values change.


### Definition of fully API-based
- The endpoint should only return structured data (e.g., JSON) for the frontend.
- No rendering or reliance on Django templates or specific backend session state.
- It should support all frontend requirements efficiently without additional processing.
