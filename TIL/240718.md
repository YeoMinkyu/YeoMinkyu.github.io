## Week 4 SQL, Models, and Migrations & Project 2 Commerce

### [Django Models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/models/)
- Are a level of abstraction on top of SQL that allow us to work with databases using Python classes and objects rather than direct SQL queries.
- The **basics**:
  - Each model is a Python class that subclasses ***django.db.models.Model***.
  - Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
  - With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API.

  ```
  models.py
  
  class AuctionListings(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField(max_length=1000)
    starting_bid = models.FloatField()
    seller = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="listings")
    category = models.ForeignKey(AuctionCategories, on_delete=models.PROTECT, related_name="listings", blank=True, null=True)
    image = models.URLField(blank=True)
    active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    date_created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
  ```

- In the first line, we create a new model that extends Django’s model class.
- Below, I add several fields for AuctionListings. There are many built-in Django Field classes.
- I will check the details about models when I review the ***Commerce*** project.

### Migrations
- Now, even though we’ve created a model, we do not yet have a database to store this information. 

    `python manage.py makemigrations`
- This command creates some Python files that will create or edit our database to be able to store what we have in our models.
- In **migrations** directory, there will be a new file was created.

![Migrations directory](/images/migration.png)
- Next, to apply these migrations to our database, I run the command

    `python manage.py migrate`

- Now, some default migrations have been applied with my own, and then I now have a file called ***db.sqlite3*** in my project's directory.
- Every time we make changes in models.py, we have to make migrations and then migrate.

### Django Admin
- Django comes with a default admin interface that allows us to do this more easily.
- It reads metadata from your models to provide a quick, model-centric interface where trusted users can manage content on your site. 
- The admin’s recommended use is limited to an organization’s internal management tool. It’s not intended for building your entire front end around.
- To begin using this tool, we must first create an administrative user:

    `python manage.py createsuperuser`

- Now, we must add our models to the admin application by entering the `admin.py` file within our app, and importing and registering our models. This tells Django which models we would like to have access to in the admin app.

```
admin.py

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import *

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(AuctionListings)
admin.site.register(AuctionCategories)
admin.site.register(AuctionBids)
admin.site.register(AuctionComments)
admin.site.register(AuctionWatchlist)
```
