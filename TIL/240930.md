## Render and Commit

1. **Triggering a render** (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen)
2. **Rendering the component** (preparing the order in the kitchen)
3. **Committing to the DOM** (placing the order on the table)


### Step 1: Trigger a render

- There are two reasons for a component to render:
  1. It’s the component’s ***initial render***.
  2. The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) ***state has been updated***.

### Initial Render

- When your app starts, you need to trigger the initial render.

```
import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Image />);
```

- It’s done by calling `createRoot` with the target DOM node, and then calling its `render` method with your component.

### Rerender when state updates

- Once the component has been initially rendered, you can trigger further renders by updating its state with the `set` function.


### Steps2: React renders your components

- **“_Rendering_” is React calling your components**.
  - **On initial render**, React will call the root component.
  - **For subsequent renders**, React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render.


### Steps3: React changes commits changes to the DOM

- After rendering (calling) your components, React will modify the DOM.
  - ***For the initial render***, React will use the `appendChild()` DOM API to put all the DOM nodes it has created on screen.
  - ***For re-renders***, React will apply the minimal necessary operations (calculated while rendering!) to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.

- React only changes the DOM nodes if there’s a difference between renders.



## State as a Sanpshot

### Setting state trigers renders

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hi!');
  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Your message is on its way!</h1>
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      setIsSent(true);
      sendMessage(message);
    }}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}

function sendMessage(message) {
  // ...
}
```

- Here’s what happens when you click the button:
  1. The `onSubmit` event handler executes.
  2. `setIsSent(true)` sets `isSent` to `true` and queues a new render.
  3. React re-renders the component according to the new `isSent` value.


### Rendering takes a snapshot in time

- ***“Rendering”*** means that React is calling your component, which is a function. The JSX you return from that function is like a snapshot of the UI in time. Its props, event handlers, and local variables were all calculated ***using its state at the time of the render***.
- The UI “snapshot” you return is interactive. It includes logic like event handlers that specify what happens in response to inputs. React updates the screen to match this snapshot and connects the event handlers. As a result, pressing a button will trigger the click handler from your JSX.
- When React re-renders a component:
  1. React calls your function again.
  2. Your function returns a new JSX snapshot.
  3. React then updates the screen to match the snapshot your function returned.

- As a component’s memory, state is not like a regular variable that disappears after your function returns. State actually “lives” in React itself—as if on a shelf!—outside of your function. When React calls your component, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render. Your component returns a snapshot of the UI with a fresh set of props and event handlers in its JSX, all calculated using the state values from that render!

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

- Notice that number only increments once per click!
- **Setting state only changes it for the next render**. During the first render, `number` was `0`. This is why, in that render’s `onClick` handler, the value of `number` is still `0` even after `setNumber(number + 1)` was called
- Here is what this button’s click handler tells React to do:
  1. `setNumber(number + 1)`: `number` is `0` so `setNumber(0 + 1)`.
     - React prepares to change `number` to `1` on the next render.
  2. `setNumber(number + 1)`: `number` is `0` so `setNumber(0 + 1)`.
     - React prepares to change `number` to `1` on the next render.
  3. `setNumber(number + 1)`: `number` is `0` so `setNumber(0 + 1)`.
     - React prepares to change `number` to `1` on the next render.
- Even though you called `setNumber(number + 1)` ***three times***, in this render’s event handler `number` is always `0`, so you set the state to `1` ***three times***. This is why, after your event handler finishes, React re-renders the component with `number` equal to `1` rather than `3`.


### State over time

- **A state variable’s value never changes within a render**, even if its event handler’s code is ***asynchronous***.

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        setTimeout(() => {
          alert(number);
        }, 3000);
      }}>+5</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

-  Inside that render’s `onClick`, the value of `number` continues to be `0` even after `setNumber(number + 5)` was called. Its value was “fixed” when React “took the snapshot” of the UI by calling your component.



## Queing a Series of State Updates

### React batches state updates

- React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates.
- The UI won’t be updated until after your event handler, and any code in it, completes. This behavior, also known as ***batching***, makes your React app run much faster.
- React does not batch across multiple intentional events like clicks—each click is handled separately.


### Updating the same state multiple times before the next render

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

- Here, `n => n + 1` is called an **updater function**. When you pass it to a state setter:
  1. React queues this function to be processed after all the other code in the event handler has run.
  2. During the next render, React goes through the queue and gives you the final updated state.

```
setNumber(n => n + 1);
setNumber(n => n + 1);
setNumber(n => n + 1);
```

- Here’s how React works through these lines of code while executing the event handler:
  1. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.
  2. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.
  3. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.

- When you call `useState` during the next render, React goes through the queue. The previous `number` state was `0`, so that’s what React passes to the first updater function as the `n` argument. Then React takes the return value of your previous updater function and passes it to the next updater as `n`, and so on:

### What happens if you update state after replacing it

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
      }}>Increase the number</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

- Here’s what this event handler tells React to do:
  1. `setNumber(number + 5)`: `number` is `0`, so `setNumber(0 + 5)`. React adds “replace with 5” to its queue.
  2. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is an **updater function**. React adds that function to its queue.

> [!NOTE]
> You may have noticed that `setState(5)` actually works like `setState(n => 5)`, but `n` is unused!


### What happens if you replace state after updating it 

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(42);
      }}>Increase the number</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

- Here’s how React works through these lines of code while executing this event handler:
  1. `setNumber(number + 5)`: `number` is `0`, so `setNumber(0 + 5)`. React adds “replace with `5`” to its queue.
  2. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is an updater function. React adds that function to its queue.
  3. `setNumber(42)`: React adds “replace with `42`” to its queue.

- To summarize, here’s how you can think of what you’re passing to the `setNumber` state setter:
  - **An updater function** (e.g. `n => n + 1`) gets added to the queue.
  - **Any other value** (e.g. number `5`) adds “replace with `5`” to the queue, ignoring what’s already queued.

- After the event handler completes, React will trigger a re-render. During the re-render, React will process the queue. Updater functions run during rendering, so ***updater functions must be pure*** and only return the result.


### Naming conventions

- It’s common to name the updater function argument by the first letters of the corresponding state variable:

```
setEnabled(e => !e);
setLastName(ln => ln.reverse());
setFriendCount(fc => fc * 2);
```
