## Managing State

## Preserving and Resetting State

### State is tied to a position in the render tree

- When you give a component state, you might think the state “lives” inside the component. But the state is actually held inside React. React associates each piece of state it’s holding with the correct component by where that component sits in the render tree.


- Here, there is only one `<Counter />` JSX tag, but it’s rendered at two different positions:

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const counter = <Counter />;
  return (
    <div>
      {counter}
      {counter}
    </div>
  );
}

function Counter() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);

  let className = 'counter';
  if (hover) {
    className += ' hover';
  }

  return (
    <div
      className={className}
      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}
      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      <h1>{score}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>
        Add one
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Here’s how these look as a tree:

![preserving state tree](/images/preserving_state_tree.webp)

- **These are two separate counters because each is rendered at its own position in the tree.** You don’t usually have to think about these positions to use React, but it can be useful to understand how it works.
- In React, each component on the screen has fully isolated state. For example, if you render two `Counter` components side by side, each of them will get its own, independent, `score` and `hover` states.

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [showB, setShowB] = useState(true);
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      {showB && <Counter />} 
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={showB}
          onChange={e => {
            setShowB(e.target.checked)
          }}
        />
        Render the second counter
      </label>
    </div>
  );
}

function Counter() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);

  let className = 'counter';
  if (hover) {
    className += ' hover';
  }

  return (
    <div
      className={className}
      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}
      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      <h1>{score}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>
        Add one
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- React will keep the state around for as long as you render the same component at the same position in the tree.
- Notice how the moment you stop rendering the second counter, its state disappears completely. That’s because when React removes a component, it destroys its state.

![preserving state remove component](/images/preserving_state_remove_component.webp)

- When you tick “Render the second counter”, a second `Counter` and its state are initialized from scratch (`score = 0`) and added to the DOM.

![preserving state add component](/images/preserving_state_add_component.webp)

- React preserves a component’s state for as long as it’s being rendered at its position in the UI tree. If it gets removed, or a different component gets rendered at the same position, React discards its state.


### Same component at the same position preserves state

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      {isFancy ? (
        <Counter isFancy={true} /> 
      ) : (
        <Counter isFancy={false} /> 
      )}
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isFancy}
          onChange={e => {
            setIsFancy(e.target.checked)
          }}
        />
        Use fancy styling
      </label>
    </div>
  );
}

function Counter({ isFancy }) {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);

  let className = 'counter';
  if (hover) {
    className += ' hover';
  }
  if (isFancy) {
    className += ' fancy';
  }

  return (
    <div
      className={className}
      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}
      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      <h1>{score}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>
        Add one
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- When you tick or clear the checkbox, the counter state does not get reset. Whether `isFancy` is `true` or `false`, you always have a `<Counter />` as the first child of the `div` returned from the root `App` component:

![preserving state same component](/images/preserving_state_same_component.webp)

- Updating the `App` state does not reset the `Counter` because `Counter` stays in the same position


### Different components at the same position reset state

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      {isPaused ? (
        <p>See you later!</p> 
      ) : (
        <Counter /> 
      )}
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isPaused}
          onChange={e => {
            setIsPaused(e.target.checked)
          }}
        />
        Take a break
      </label>
    </div>
  );
}

function Counter() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);

  let className = 'counter';
  if (hover) {
    className += ' hover';
  }

  return (
    <div
      className={className}
      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}
      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      <h1>{score}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>
        Add one
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Here, you switch between different component types at the same position. Initially, the first child of the `<div>` contained a `Counter`. But when you swapped in a `p`, React removed the `Counter` from the UI tree and destroyed its state.

![preserving state diff pt1](/images/preserving_state_diff_pt1.webp)

- When `Counter` changes to `p`, the `Counter` is deleted and the `p` is added

![preserving state diff pt2](/images/preserving_state_diff_pt2.webp)

- When switching back, the `p` is deleted and the `Counter` is added

- Also, when you render a different component in the same position, it resets the state of its entire subtree.

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      {isFancy ? (
        <div>
          <Counter isFancy={true} /> 
        </div>
      ) : (
        <section>
          <Counter isFancy={false} />
        </section>
      )}
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isFancy}
          onChange={e => {
            setIsFancy(e.target.checked)
          }}
        />
        Use fancy styling
      </label>
    </div>
  );
}

...
```

- The counter state gets reset when you click the checkbox. Although you render a `Counter`, the first child of the `div` changes from a `div` to a `section`. When the child `div` was removed from the DOM, the whole tree below it (including the `Counter` and its state) was destroyed as well.

![preserving state diff same pt1](/images/preserving_state_diff_same_pt1.webp)

- When `section` changes to `div`, the `section` is deleted and the new `div` is added

![preserving state diff same pt2](/images/preserving_state_diff_same_pt2.webp)

- When switching back, the `div` is deleted and the new `section` is added

- As a rule of thumb, if you want to preserve the state between re-renders, the structure of your tree needs to “match up” from one render to another. If the structure is different, the state gets destroyed because React destroys state when it removes a component from the tree.


### Resetting state at the same position
- There are two ways to reset state when switching between them:
  1. Render components in different positions
  2. Give each component an explicit identity with key

    ### Option 1: Rendering a component in different positions
    ```
    import { useState } from 'react';

    export default function Scoreboard() {
    const [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true);
    return (
            <div>
            {isPlayerA &&
                <Counter person="Taylor" />
            }
            {!isPlayerA &&
                <Counter person="Sarah" />
            }
            <button onClick={() => {
                setIsPlayerA(!isPlayerA);
            }}>
                Next player!
            </button>
            </div>
        );
    }

    function Counter({ person }) {
    const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
    const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);

    let className = 'counter';
    if (hover) {
        className += ' hover';
    }

    return (
            <div
            className={className}
            onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}
            onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}
            >
            <h1>{person}'s score: {score}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>
                Add one
            </button>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```
    - Initially, `isPlayerA` is `true`. So the first position contains `Counter` state, and the second one is empty.
    - When you click the “Next player” button the first position clears but the second one now contains a `Counter`.
    - Each `Counter`’s state gets destroyed each time it’s removed from the DOM. This is why they reset every time you click the button.
    - This solution is convenient **when you only have a few independent components rendered in the same place.** In this example, you only have two, so it’s not a hassle to render both separately in the JSX.

    
    ### Option 2: Resetting state with a key

    - You can use `key`s to make React distinguish between any components.

    ```
    import { useState } from 'react';

    export default function Scoreboard() {
    const [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true);
    return (
            <div>
            {isPlayerA ? (
                <Counter key="Taylor" person="Taylor" />
            ) : (
                <Counter key="Sarah" person="Sarah" />
            )}
            <button onClick={() => {
                setIsPlayerA(!isPlayerA);
            }}>
                Next player!
            </button>
            </div>
        );
    }

    function Counter({ person }) {
    const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
    const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);

    let className = 'counter';
    if (hover) {
        className += ' hover';
    }

    return (
            <div
            className={className}
            onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}
            onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}
            >
            <h1>{person}'s score: {score}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>
                Add one
            </button>
            </div>
        );
    }

    ```

    - Switching between Taylor and Sarah does not preserve the state. This is because you gave them different `key`s.
    - Specifying a `key` tells React to use the `key` itself as part of the position, instead of their order within the parent. This is why, even though you render them in the same place in JSX, React sees them as two different counters, and so they will never share state.

    > ![NOTE]
    > Remember that keys are not globally unique. They only specify the position within the parent.


    ### Resetting a form with a key

    - Resetting state with a key is particularly useful when dealing with forms.

    ```
    import { useState } from 'react';
    import Chat from './Chat.js';
    import ContactList from './ContactList.js';

    export default function Messenger() {
    const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]);
    return (
            <div>
            <ContactList
                contacts={contacts}
                selectedContact={to}
                onSelect={contact => setTo(contact)}
            />
            <Chat key={to.id} contact={to} />
            </div>
        )
    }

    const contacts = [
    { id: 0, name: 'Taylor', email: 'taylor@mail.com' },
    { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@mail.com' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@mail.com' }
    ];
    ```

    ```
    <Chat key={to.id} contact={to} />
    ```

    - This ensures that when you select a different recipient, the `Chat` component will be recreated from scratch, including any state in the tree below it. React will also re-create the DOM elements instead of reusing them.
