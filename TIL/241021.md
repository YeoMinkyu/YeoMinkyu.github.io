## Managing State

## Passing Data Deeply with Context

### The problem with passing props

- Passing props can become verbose and inconvenient when you need to pass some prop deeply through the tree, or if many components need the same prop. The nearest common ancestor could be far removed from the components that need data, and lifting state up that high can lead to a situation called “prop drilling”.
- Prop drilling:

### Context: an alternative to passing props

- Context lets a parent component provide data to the entire tree below it. There are many uses for context. Here is one example. Consider this Heading component that accepts a level for its size. Currently, you pass the `level` prop to each `<Heading>` separately:

```javascript
export default function Heading({ level, children }) {
  switch (level) {
    case 1:
      return <h1>{children}</h1>;
    case 2:
      return <h2>{children}</h2>;
    case 3:
      return <h3>{children}</h3>;
    case 4:
      return <h4>{children}</h4>;
    case 5:
      return <h5>{children}</h5>;
    case 6:
      return <h6>{children}</h6>;
    default:
      throw Error('Unknown level: ' + level);
  }
}
```

```javascript
<Section>
  <Heading level={3}>About</Heading>
  <Heading level={3}>Photos</Heading>
  <Heading level={3}>Videos</Heading>
</Section>
```

- It would be nice if you could pass the `level` prop to the `<Section>` component instead and remove it from the `<Heading>`. This way you could enforce that all headings in the same section have the same size:

```javascript
<Section level={3}>
  <Heading>About</Heading>
  <Heading>Photos</Heading>
  <Heading>Videos</Heading>
</Section>
```

- But how can the `<Heading>` component know the level of its closest `<Section>`? That would require some way for a child to “ask” for data from somewhere above in the tree.
- You can’t do it with props alone. This is where context comes into play. You will do it in three steps:
  1. **Create** a context. (You can call it `LevelContext`, since it’s for the heading level.)
  2. **Use** that context from the component that needs the data. (`Heading` will use `LevelContext`.)
  3. **Provide** that context from the component that specifies the data. (`Section` will provide `LevelContext`.)

- Context lets a parent—even a distant one!—provide some data to the entire tree inside of it.

- Using context in distant children


### Step 1: Create the context

- First, you need to create the context. You’ll need to export it from a file so that your components can use it, `LevelContext.js`:

```javascript
import { createContext } from 'react';

export const LevelContext = createContext(1);
```

- The only argument to `createContext` is the default value. Here, `1` refers to the biggest heading level, but you could pass any kind of value (even an object).


### Step 2: Use the context

- Import the `useContext` Hook from React and your context:

```javascript
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';
```

- Currently, the `Heading` component reads `level` from props:

```javascript
export default function Heading({ level, children }) {
  // ...
}
```

- Instead, remove the `level` prop and read the value from the context you just imported, `LevelContext`:

```javascript
export default function Heading({ children }) {
  const level = useContext(LevelContext);
  // ...
}
```

- `useContext` is a Hook. Just like `useState` and `useReducer`, you can only call a Hook immediately inside a React component (not inside loops or conditions). `useContext` tells React that the `Heading` component wants to read the `LevelContext`.

- Now that the `Heading` component doesn’t have a `level` prop, you don’t need to pass the `level` prop to `Heading` in your JSX like this anymore:

```javascript
<Section>
  <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
  <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
  <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
</Section>
```

- Update the JSX so that it’s the `Section` that receives it instead:

```javascript
<Section level={4}>
  <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
  <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
  <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
</Section>
```

```javascript
import Heading from './Heading.js';
import Section from './Section.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Section level={1}>
      <Heading>Title</Heading>
      <Section level={2}>
        <Heading>Heading</Heading>
        <Heading>Heading</Heading>
        <Heading>Heading</Heading>
        <Section level={3}>
          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>
          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>
          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>
          <Section level={4}>
            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
          </Section>
        </Section>
      </Section>
    </Section>
  );
}
```

- Notice this example doesn’t quite work, yet! All the headings have the same size because **even though you’re using the context, you have not provided it yet**. React doesn’t know where to get it!

- If you don’t provide the context, React will use the default value you’ve specified in the previous step. In this example, you specified `1` as the argument to `createContext`, so `useContext(LevelContext)` returns `1`, setting all those headings to `<h1>`.


### Step 3: Provie the context

- The `Section` component currently renders its children:

```javascript
export default function Section({ children }) {
  return (
    <section className="section">
      {children}
    </section>
  );
}
```

- **Wrap them with a context provider** to provide the `LevelContext` to them:

```javascript
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';

export default function Section({ level, children }) {
  return (
    <section className="section">
      <LevelContext.Provider value={level}>
        {children}
      </LevelContext.Provider>
    </section>
  );
}
```

- This tells React: “if any component inside this `<Section>` asks for `LevelContext`, give them this `level`.” The component will use the value of the nearest `<LevelContext.Provider>` in the UI tree above it.

- It’s the same result as the original code, but you did not need to pass the `level` prop to each `Heading` component! Instead, it “figures out” its heading level by asking the closest `Section` above:
  1. You pass a `level` prop to the `<Section>`.
  2. `Section` wraps its children into `<LevelContext.Provider value={level}>`.
  3. `Heading` asks the closest value of `LevelContext` above with `useContext(LevelContext)`.


### Using and providing context from the same component

- Currently, you still have to specify each section’s `level` manually:

```javascript
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Section level={1}>
      ...
      <Section level={2}>
        ...
        <Section level={3}>
          ...
```

- Since context lets you read information from a component above, each `Section` could read the `level` from the `Section` above, and pass `level + 1` down automatically. Here is how you could do it:

```javascript
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';

export default function Section({ children }) {
  const level = useContext(LevelContext);
  return (
    <section className="section">
      <LevelContext.Provider value={level + 1}>
        {children}
      </LevelContext.Provider>
    </section>
  );
}
```

- With this change, you don’t need to pass the `level` prop either to the `<Section>` or to the `<Heading>`.
- Now both `Heading` and `Section` read the `LevelContext` to figure out how “deep” they are. And the `Section` wraps its children into the `LevelContext` to specify that anything inside of it is at a “deeper” level.


### Context passes through intermediate components

- You can insert as many components as you like between the component that provides context and the one that uses it. This includes both built-in components like `<div>` and components you might build yourself.

- In this example, the same `Post` component (with a dashed border) is rendered at two different nesting levels. Notice that the `<Heading>` inside of it gets its level automatically from the closest `<Section>`, `App.js`:

```javascript
import Heading from './Heading.js';
import Section from './Section.js';

export default function ProfilePage() {
  return (
    <Section>
      <Heading>My Profile</Heading>
      <Post
        title="Hello traveller!"
        body="Read about my adventures."
      />
      <AllPosts />
    </Section>
  );
}

function AllPosts() {
  return (
    <Section>
      <Heading>Posts</Heading>
      <RecentPosts />
    </Section>
  );
}

function RecentPosts() {
  return (
    <Section>
      <Heading>Recent Posts</Heading>
      <Post
        title="Flavors of Lisbon"
        body="...those pastéis de nata!"
      />
      <Post
        title="Buenos Aires in the rhythm of tango"
        body="I loved it!"
      />
    </Section>
  );
}

function Post({ title, body }) {
  return (
    <Section isFancy={true}>
      <Heading>
        {title}
      </Heading>
      <p><i>{body}</i></p>
    </Section>
  );
}
```

- `Section.js`:

```javascript
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';

export default function Section({ children, isFancy }) {
  const level = useContext(LevelContext);
  return (
    <section className={
      'section ' +
      (isFancy ? 'fancy' : '')
    }>
      <LevelContext.Provider value={level + 1}>
        {children}
      </LevelContext.Provider>
    </section>
  );
}
```

-  A `Section` specifies the context for the tree inside it, so you can insert a `<Heading>` anywhere, and it will have the correct size. **Context lets you write components that “adapt to their surroundings” and display themselves differently depending on where (or, in other words, in which context) they are being rendered.**


### Before you use context

- Context is very tempting to use! However, this also means it’s too easy to overuse it. Just because you need to pass some props several levels deep doesn’t mean you should put that information into context.

- Here’s a few alternatives you should consider before using context:
  1. **Start by passing props.**  If your components are not trivial, it’s not unusual to pass a dozen props down through a dozen components. It may feel like a slog, but it makes it very clear which components use which data! The person maintaining your code will be glad you’ve made the data flow explicit with props.
  2. **Extract components and pass JSX as children to them.** If you pass some data through many layers of intermediate components that don’t use that data (and only pass it further down), this often means that you forgot to extract some components along the way. For example, maybe you pass data props like posts to visual components that don’t use them directly, like `<Layout posts={posts} />`. Instead, make `Layout` take children as a prop, and render `<Layout><Posts posts={posts} /></Layout>`. This reduces the number of layers between the component specifying the data and the one that needs it.

- If neither of these approaches works well for you, consider context.


### Use cases for context

- **Theming**: If your app lets the user change its appearance (e.g. dark mode), you can put a context provider at the top of your app, and use that context in components that need to adjust their visual look.
- **Current account**: Many components might need to know the currently logged in user. Putting it in context makes it convenient to read it anywhere in the tree. Some apps also let you operate multiple accounts at the same time (e.g. to leave a comment as a different user). In those cases, it can be convenient to wrap a part of the UI into a nested provider with a different current account value.
- **Routing**: Most routing solutions use context internally to hold the current route. This is how every link “knows” whether it’s active or not. If you build your own router, you might want to do it too.
- **Managing state**: As your app grows, you might end up with a lot of state closer to the top of your app. Many distant components below may want to change it. It is common to use a reducer together with context to manage complex state and pass it down to distant components without too much hassle.

- **Context is not limited to static values.** If you pass a different value on the next render, React will update all the components reading it below! This is why context is often used in combination with state.



## Scailing Up with Reducer and Context

### Combining a reducer with context

```javascript
import { useReducer } from 'react';
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(
    tasksReducer,
    initialTasks
  );

  function handleAddTask(text) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'added',
      id: nextId++,
      text: text,
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed',
      task: task
    });
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'deleted',
      id: taskId
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Day off in Kyoto</h1>
      <AddTask
        onAddTask={handleAddTask}
      />
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />
    </>
  );
}

function tasksReducer(tasks, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      return [...tasks, {
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        done: false
      }];
    }
    case 'changed': {
      return tasks.map(t => {
        if (t.id === action.task.id) {
          return action.task;
        } else {
          return t;
        }
      });
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return tasks.filter(t => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}

let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  { id: 0, text: 'Philosopher’s Path', done: true },
  { id: 1, text: 'Visit the temple', done: false },
  { id: 2, text: 'Drink matcha', done: false }
];
```

- A reducer helps keep the event handlers short and concise. However, as your app grows, you might run into another difficulty. Currently, the `tasks` state and the `dispatch` function are only available in the top-level `TaskApp` component. To let other components read the list of tasks or change it, you have to explicitly pass down the current state and the event handlers that change it as props.

- For example, `TaskApp` passes a list of tasks and the event handlers to `TaskList`:

```javascript
<TaskList
  tasks={tasks}
  onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
  onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
/>
```

- And `TaskList` passes the event handlers to `Task`:

```javascript
<Task
  task={task}
  onChange={onChangeTask}
  onDelete={onDeleteTask}
/>
```

- In a small example like this, this works well, but if you have tens or hundreds of components in the middle, passing down all state and functions can be quite frustrating!

- This is why, as an alternative to passing them through props, you might want to put both the `tasks` state and the `dispatch` function into context. **This way, any component below TaskApp in the tree can read the tasks and dispatch actions without the repetitive “prop drilling”.**

- Here is how you can combine a reducer with context:
  1. **Create** the context.
  2. **Put** state and dispatch into context.
  3. **Use** context anywhere in the tree.


### Step 1: Create the context

- The `useReducer` Hook returns the current `tasks` and the `dispatch` function that lets you update them:

```javascript
const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);
```

- To pass them down the tree, you will create two separate contexts:
  - `TasksContext` provides the current list of tasks.
  - `TasksDispatchContext` provides the function that lets components dispatch actions.

- Export them from a separate file so that you can later import them from other files:

```javascript
import { createContext } from 'react';

export const TasksContext = createContext(null);
export const TasksDispatchContext = createContext(null);
```

- Here, you’re passing `null` as the default value to both contexts. The actual values will be provided by the `TaskApp` component.


### Step 2: Put state and dispatch into context

- Now you can import both contexts in your `TaskApp` component. Take the `tasks` and `dispatch` returned by `useReducer()` and provide them to the entire tree below:

```javascript
import { TasksContext, TasksDispatchContext } from './TasksContext.js';

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);
  // ...
  return (
    <TasksContext.Provider value={tasks}>
      <TasksDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
        ...
      </TasksDispatchContext.Provider>
    </TasksContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

- For now, you pass the information both via props and in context:

```javascript
import { useReducer } from 'react';
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';
import { TasksContext, TasksDispatchContext } from './TasksContext.js';

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(
    tasksReducer,
    initialTasks
  );

  function handleAddTask(text) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'added',
      id: nextId++,
      text: text,
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed',
      task: task
    });
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'deleted',
      id: taskId
    });
  }

  return (
    <TasksContext.Provider value={tasks}>
      <TasksDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
        <h1>Day off in Kyoto</h1>
        <AddTask
          onAddTask={handleAddTask}
        />
        <TaskList
          tasks={tasks}
          onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
          onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
        />
      </TasksDispatchContext.Provider>
    </TasksContext.Provider>
  );
}

function tasksReducer(tasks, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      return [...tasks, {
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        done: false
      }];
    }
    case 'changed': {
      return tasks.map(t => {
        if (t.id === action.task.id) {
          return action.task;
        } else {
          return t;
        }
      });
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return tasks.filter(t => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}

let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  { id: 0, text: 'Philosopher’s Path', done: true },
  { id: 1, text: 'Visit the temple', done: false },
  { id: 2, text: 'Drink matcha', done: false }
];
```


### Step 3: Use context anywhere in the tree

- Now you don’t need to pass the list of tasks or the event handlers down the tree:

```javascript
<TasksContext.Provider value={tasks}>
  <TasksDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
    <h1>Day off in Kyoto</h1>
    <AddTask />
    <TaskList />
  </TasksDispatchContext.Provider>
</TasksContext.Provider>
```

- Instead, any component that needs the task list can read it from the `TaskContext`:

```javascript
export default function TaskList() {
  const tasks = useContext(TasksContext);
  // ...
```

- To update the task list, any component can read the `dispatch` function from context and call it:

```javascript
export default function AddTask() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const dispatch = useContext(TasksDispatchContext);
  // ...
  return (
    // ...
    <button onClick={() => {
      setText('');
      dispatch({
        type: 'added',
        id: nextId++,
        text: text,
      });
    }}>Add</button>
    // ...
```

- The `TaskApp` component does not pass any event handlers down, and the `TaskList` does not pass any event handlers to the `Task` component either. Each component reads the context that it needs:

```javascript
import { useState, useContext } from 'react';
import { TasksContext, TasksDispatchContext } from './TasksContext.js';

export default function TaskList() {
  const tasks = useContext(TasksContext);
  return (
    <ul>
      {tasks.map(task => (
        <li key={task.id}>
          <Task task={task} />
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

function Task({ task }) {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  const dispatch = useContext(TasksDispatchContext);
  let taskContent;
  if (isEditing) {
    taskContent = (
      <>
        <input
          value={task.text}
          onChange={e => {
            dispatch({
              type: 'changed',
              task: {
                ...task,
                text: e.target.value
              }
            });
          }} />
        <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(false)}>
          Save
        </button>
      </>
    );
  } else {
    taskContent = (
      <>
        {task.text}
        <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(true)}>
          Edit
        </button>
      </>
    );
  }
  return (
    <label>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        checked={task.done}
        onChange={e => {
          dispatch({
            type: 'changed',
            task: {
              ...task,
              done: e.target.checked
            }
          });
        }}
      />
      {taskContent}
      <button onClick={() => {
        dispatch({
          type: 'deleted',
          id: task.id
        });
      }}>
        Delete
      </button>
    </label>
  );
}
```

- The `state` still “lives” in the top-level `TaskApp` component, managed with `useReducer`. But its `tasks` and `dispatch` are now available to every component below in the tree by importing and using these contexts.


### Moving all wiring into a single file

- You don’t have to do this, but you could further declutter the components by moving both reducer and context into a single file. Currently, `TasksContext.js` contains only two context declarations:

```javascript
import { createContext } from 'react';

export const TasksContext = createContext(null);
export const TasksDispatchContext = createContext(null);
```

- This file is about to get crowded! You’ll move the reducer into that same file. Then you’ll declare a new `TasksProvider` component in the same file. This component will tie all the pieces together:
  1. It will manage the state with a reducer.
  2. It will provide both contexts to components below.
  3. It will take children as a prop so you can pass JSX to it.

```javascript
import { createContext, useReducer } from 'react';

export const TasksContext = createContext(null);
export const TasksDispatchContext = createContext(null);

export function TasksProvider({ children }) {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(
    tasksReducer,
    initialTasks
  );

  return (
    <TasksContext.Provider value={tasks}>
      <TasksDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
        {children}
      </TasksDispatchContext.Provider>
    </TasksContext.Provider>
  );
}

function tasksReducer(tasks, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      return [...tasks, {
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        done: false
      }];
    }
    case 'changed': {
      return tasks.map(t => {
        if (t.id === action.task.id) {
          return action.task;
        } else {
          return t;
        }
      });
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return tasks.filter(t => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}

const initialTasks = [
  { id: 0, text: 'Philosopher’s Path', done: true },
  { id: 1, text: 'Visit the temple', done: false },
  { id: 2, text: 'Drink matcha', done: false }
];
```

- **This removes all the complexity and wiring from your `TaskApp` component**:

```javascript
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';
import { TasksProvider } from './TasksContext.js';

export default function TaskApp() {
  return (
    <TasksProvider>
      <h1>Day off in Kyoto</h1>
      <AddTask />
      <TaskList />
    </TasksProvider>
  );
}
```

- You can also export functions that use the context from `TasksContext.js`:

```javascript
export function useTasks() {
  return useContext(TasksContext);
}

export function useTasksDispatch() {
  return useContext(TasksDispatchContext);
}
```

- When a component needs to read context, it can do it through these functions:

```javascript
const tasks = useTasks();
const dispatch = useTasksDispatch();
```

-  Now all of the context and reducer wiring is in TasksContext.js. This keeps the components clean and uncluttered, focused on what they display rather than where they get the data.

- You can think of `TasksProvider` as **a part of the screen that knows how to deal with tasks**, `useTasks` as **a way to read them**, and `useTasksDispatch` as **a way to update them from any component below in the tree**.

> [!NOTE]
> Functions like `useTasks` and `useTasksDispatch` are called ***Custom Hooks***. Your function is considered a custom Hook if its name starts with `use`. This lets you use other Hooks, like `useContext`, inside it.
