## Django

### Project vs App

- An app is a web application that does something â€“ e.g., a blog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. An app can be in multiple projects.
- A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps.

### Save the model to the database

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
```

- Django will write a migration file that contains the SQL for it after I create a new model.

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

- Django executes that SQL and actually creates the `JournalEntry` table in your database.


### ViewSet

- Is like a class-based view designed for RESTful APIs. It automatically handles the logic for multiple API actions.

### Router

- Maps your `ViewSet` to real URLs like `/api/entries/`.
