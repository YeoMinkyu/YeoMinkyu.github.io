## Understanding CSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery)

- It’s a type of security threat that Django helps protect your web app from.
- **CSRF token** : When you load a page with a form (like a login or payment form), Django sneaks in a unique, random code (the token) that only your app and your browser know. When you submit the form, Django checks if the token matches. If it does, great—it’s really you! If not, it blocks the request, keeping the bad guys out.

### How CSRF token works in Django

1. Token Generation
2. Token Storage
3. Form Submission
4. Token Validation
5. Security Enforcement

### Roles of `@csrf_exempt`

- The `@csrf_exempt` decorator tells Django to skip this CSRF check for a particular view.
