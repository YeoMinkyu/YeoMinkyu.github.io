    while True:

### Why You Thought O(2n) → O(n)
Your reasoning:
- **`find()`:** Loops through `self._size` (n) elements to find the first occurrence, so O(n).
- **`delete()`:** Shifts elements left, worst case O(n) when deleting from the start.
- **While Loop:** You assumed `find()` and `delete()` run “independently” in each iteration, and since they’re both O(n), you added them: O(n) + O(n) = O(2n), which simplifies to O(n) in Big-O notation (constants like 2 drop out).

This makes sense if you think the loop runs a fixed number of times (e.g., once or twice). But the catch is that the number of iterations depends on how many times `item` appears in the vector, and that changes the game.

---

### Why It’s Actually O(n²) in the Worst Case
The key insight: **The `while` loop doesn’t run a constant number of times—it runs once for each occurrence of `item` in the vector, and each iteration involves O(n) work from `find()` and `delete()`.**

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **`find()`:**
   - Linear search: O(n) to scan up to `self._size` elements.
   - Returns the first index of `item` or -1 if not found.

2. **`delete()`:**
   - Shifts elements left: O(n) in the worst case (e.g., deleting at index 0 shifts all n elements).
   - Reduces `self._size` by 1.

3. **`while` Loop:**
   - Repeats until `find()` returns -1 (no more occurrences).
   - Number of iterations = number of times `item` appears in the vector (let’s call this `k`).

4. **Total Work:**
   - Each iteration does `find()` (O(n)) + `delete()` (O(n)) = O(n) work.
   - If `k` iterations occur, total time = O(n) * k.

#### Worst Case:
- **Scenario:** Vector where `item` appears in every position, e.g., `[1, 1, 1]` (size n = 3, all elements are 1).
- **Execution:**
  - **Iteration 1:** `find()` scans 3 elements (O(n)), finds 1 at index 0; `delete()` shifts 2 elements (O(n)). Vector: `[1, 1]`, size = 2.
  - **Iteration 2:** `find()` scans 2 elements (O(n)), finds 1 at 0; `delete()` shifts 1 element (O(n)). Vector: `[1]`, size = 1.
  - **Iteration 3:** `find()` scans 1 element (O(n)), finds 1 at 0; `delete()` shifts 0 elements (O(n)). Vector: `[]`, size = 0.
  - **Iteration 4:** `find()` scans 0 elements, returns -1, loop ends.
- **Number of Iterations (k):** Equals initial `self._size` (n = 3 here), because every element is removed.
- **Total Cost:**
  - `find()` costs: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 (sum of scans).
  - `delete()` costs: 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 (sum of shifts).
  - Total operations ≈ n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 for `find()`, plus similar for `delete()`.
  - This is the sum of the first n numbers: `n * (n + 1) / 2`, which is O(n²).

#### Math Check:
- Sum of 1 to n = `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
- For n = 3: `3 * 4 / 2 = 6`, matches our `find()` steps.
- Combined with `delete()`, it’s still O(n²) because both contribute n * (n-1) / 2-ish terms.

### O(2n) vs. O(n²): The Difference
- **O(2n) = O(n):**
  - Linear growth: Double the input size (n), double the work.
  - Example: One `find()` (O(n)) + one `delete()` (O(n)) = O(2n), but Big-O drops constants, so O(n).
  - Happens if the loop runs a *fixed number of times* (e.g., remove only the first occurrence).

- **O(n²):**
  - Quadratic growth: Double the input size (n), work increases by a factor of 4 (n²).
  - Example: If n = 3 → 9 operations, n = 6 → 36 operations (roughly).
  - Happens when the loop runs *proportional to n* times, each doing O(n) work.

#### Your Misstep:
- You assumed “independent execution” means adding `find()` and `delete()` once, but the `while` loop multiplies their cost by the number of iterations (k). In the worst case, k ≈ n, so O(n) * n = O(n²).

#### Easy Analogy:
- **O(2n):** Cleaning 2 rooms, each takes n minutes → 2n minutes total (linear).
- **O(n²):** Cleaning n rooms, but each room takes n minutes because you recheck everything → n * n = n² minutes (quadratic).

### Example to Drive It Home
- **Vector:** `[5, 5, 5, 5]` (n = 4), `remove(5)`.
- **Steps:**
  1. `find()`: Scan 4, find 5 at 0, `delete()`: Shift 3 → `[5, 5, 5]`.
  2. `find()`: Scan 3, find 5 at 0, `delete()`: Shift 2 → `[5, 5]`.
  3. `find()`: Scan 2, find 5 at 0, `delete()`: Shift 1 → `[5]`.
  4. `find()`: Scan 1, find 5 at 0, `delete()`: Shift 0 → `[]`.
  5. `find()`: Scan 0, -1, stop.
- **Work:** `find()`: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10, `delete()`: 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 6. Total ≈ 16 ≈ 4².
- **Pattern:** Work scales with n², not 2n.

---

### Correct Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** Item appears once or not at all → 1 `find()` (O(n)) + 1 `delete()` (O(n)) = O(n).
- **Worst Case:** Item appears n times (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`) → n iterations, each O(n) → O(n²).
- **Average Case:** Depends on number of occurrences (k), typically O(k * n), but we focus on worst case for Big-O.

**Updated Comment:**
```python
def remove(self, item: int) -> None:
    """Remove all instances of item, shift elements left.
    Time Complexity: O(n²) in worst case where n is size of vector
    Space Complexity: O(1) extra space
    """
```

### How to Distinguish O(2n) vs. O(n²)
- **Look at Loops:**
  - **Single Loop:** O(n) if it does O(1) work per iteration (e.g., one pass over n elements).
  - **Nested Loops or Repeated O(n) Work:** O(n²) if an O(n) operation repeats n times (e.g., `while` loop calling O(n) methods n times).
- **Constants Drop:** O(2n) means two O(n) operations added or a single loop with 2n steps → still O(n).
- **Multiplication:** O(n²) means n iterations of O(n) work, like nested loops or your `remove()` case.
- **Test Scaling:**
  - Double n:
    - O(2n): Work doubles (e.g., 10 → 20).
    - O(n²): Work quadruples (e.g., 10 → 40).

#### Your Case:
- `remove()`: `while` loop runs up to n times (if all elements are `item`), each doing O(n) work (`find()` + `delete()`). That’s n * O(n) = O(n²), not O(2n).

---

### Takeaway
- **O(2n):** Two independent O(n) operations, total work scales linearly.
- **O(n²):** O(n) work repeated n times, total work scales quadratically.
- **Your `remove()`:** Iterations depend on n (worst case), each O(n), so O(n²).
