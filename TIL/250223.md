## Explanation of part of React application setup

```javascript
function loadPost() {
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('app'));
    root.render(<SocialNetworkApp />);
}
```

- `function loadPost() { ... }`: This function, `loadPost`, encapsulates the logic to mount your React application onto the DOM.
- `const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('app'));`: This line of code uses the `ReactDOM.createRoot` method, introduced in React 18, to create a root container from the DOM element with the id of 'app'. This is where your React component tree will be rendered. It's important that there is a corresponding element with id="app" in your HTML.
- `root.render(<SocialNetworkApp />);`: This line renders the `<SocialNetworkApp />` React component into the root container you created. This is the entry point for your React application, initiating the component hierarchy rendering.


```javascript
// Ensure that the component only loads after the DOM is fully loaded
window.onload = function() {
    loadPost();
};
```

- `window.onload = function() { ... };`: This line sets up an event handler for the load event on the window object, which fires when the entire page (including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images) is fully loaded. Here, it ensures that the `loadPost` function (which initializes your React app) is called only once the page is fully prepared.
