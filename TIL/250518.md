## React

### Router DOM

- Is the official way to handle the navigation(pages and URLs) in a React app.
- It tells to React what components to show when the user visits a certain URL.

### Why Router DOM is needed in React?

- Because React is a Single Page Application(SPA).
- So, you don't need to reload the whole page to change content.
- Instead, React dynamically swap the components.

### `BrowserRouter`

- Enable routing based on browser URL

### `Routes`

- Container for all `Route` elements

### `Route`

- Maps a URL path to a React component

### `useNavigate()`

- Programmatically change the URL

### `Link`

- Navigate to other pages without refreshing


### Effects

- Let you 'step out' of React and synchronize your components with some external system.

### No need Effects

1. To transform data for rendering
2. To handle user events
