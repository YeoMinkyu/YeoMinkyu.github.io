### Animation

- **CSS** makes it easy for us to animate HTML elements.
- To create an animation in **CSS**, we use the format below, where the animation specifics can include starting and ending styles (`to` and `from`) or styles at different stages in the duration (anywhere from `0%` to `100%`). For example:

```
@keyframes animation_name {
    from {
        /* Some styling for the start */
    }

    to {
        /* Some styling for the end */
    }
}
```
```
@keyframes animation_name {
    0% {
        /* Some styling for the start */
    }

    75% {
        /* Some styling after 3/4 of animation */
    }

    100% {
        /* Some styling for the end */
    }
}
```

- Then, to apply an animation to an element, we include the `animation-name`, the `animation-duration` (in seconds), and the `animation-fill-mode` (typically `forwards`).
- For example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Animate</title>
        <style>
            @keyframes grow {
                from {
                    font-size: 20px;
                }
                to {
                    font-size: 100px;
                }
            }

            h1 {
                animation-name: grow;
                animation-duration: 2s;
                animation-fill-mode: forwards;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
``` 

### React

- We can mitigate how much code we actually need to write by employing a **JavaScript** framework.
- One of the most popular JavaScript frameworks is a library called **React**.
- **Imperative programming** : We give the computer a set of statements to execute.
- **React** allows us to use **declarative programming**.
- **Declarative programming** : Will allow us to simply write code explaining what we wish to display and not worry about how we’re displaying it.
- The **React** framework is built around the idea of ***components***, each of which can have an underlying state.
- A ***component*** would be something you can see on a web page like a post or a navigation bar.
- A ***state*** is a set of variables associated with that ***component***.
- To use React directly in an HTML file, we’ll have to import three JavaScript Packages:
  1. **React**: Defines components and their behavior.
  2. **ReactDOM**: Takes React components and inserts them into the DOM.
  3. **Babel**: Translates from **JSX**, the language in which we’ll write in React, to plain JavaScript that our browsers can interpret. **JSX** is very similar to JavaScript, but with some additional features, including the ability to represent HTML inside of our code.

  ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
            <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
            <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
            <title>Hello</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="app"></div>

            <script type="text/babel">
                function App() {
                    return (
                        <div>
                            Hello!
                        </div>
                    );
                }

                ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector("#app"));
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
  ```
  
- In the three lines above the title, we import the latest versions of **React**, **ReactDOM**, and **Babel**.
- `type="text/babel"` signals to the browser that the following script needs to be translated using **Babel**.
- Next, we create a ***component*** called `App`. Components in **React** can be represented by **JavaScript** functions.
- Our component returns what we would like to render to the DOM; `<div>Hello!</div>`
- The last line of our script employs the `ReactDOM.render` function, which takes two arguments:
  1. A component to render
  2. An element in the DOM inside of which the component should be rendered
- We can make these components more flexible by adding additional properties (props in React terms) to them.
```
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Hello name="Harry" />
            <Hello name="Ron" />
            <Hello name="Hermione" />
        </div>
    );
}
```

- We can then access those props using `props.PROP_NAME`. We can then insert this into our JSX using ***curly braces({})***:

```
function Hello(props) {
    return (
        <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
    );
}
```

- `useState`: To add state to our component.
- The argument to `useState` is the initial value of the state.
- The function returns both a variable representing the state and a function that allows us to update the state.

```
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
```

- `setState`: Can take as argument a new value for the state.

```
function updateCount() {
    setCount(count + 1);
}
```
