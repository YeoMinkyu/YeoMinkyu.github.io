### [Working with form](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/forms/)
**GET and POST**
- **GET** and **POST** are the only HTTP methods to use dealing with forms.

_search.html_
```
<form action="{% url 'encyclopedia:search' %}" method="get">
    <input class="search" type="text" name="q" placeholder="Search Encyclopedia">
</form>
```
- **GET** should be used only for requests that do not affect the state of the system.
- **GET** is suitable for things like a web search form, because the URLs that represnts a **GET** request can easily be bookmarked, shared and resubmitted. 

_new-page.html_
```
<form action="{% url 'encyclopedia:create' %}" method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{title_form}}
        <label for="new-entry-contents">Content:</label>
        <br>
        <textarea id="new-entry-contents" name="new-entry-contents" rows="4" cols="20">Write contents here</textarea>
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Save">
    </form>
```
- Any request that could be used to change the state of the system, for example a request that makes changes in the database, should use **POST**

**Django's role in forms**

1. preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering.
2. create HTML forms for the data.
3. receiving and processing submitted forms and data from the client.

**The Django `FORM` class**
- A **FORM** calss describes a form and determines how it works and appears.

**Building a form in Django**

_new-page.html_
```
<form action="{% url 'encyclopedia:create' %}" method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{title_form}}
        <label for="new-entry-contents">Content:</label>
        <br>
        <textarea id="new-entry-contents" name="new-entry-contents" rows="4" cols="20">Write contents here</textarea>
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Save">
    </form>
```
- This tells the browser to return to form data to the URL ***encyclopedia:create***, using **POST** method. It will display a textarea field, labeld "Content:" and button marked "Save".
- When the form is submitted, the **POST** request which is sent to the server will contain the form data.
- There is a view corresponding to that ***encyclopedia:create** which will find appropriate key/value paris in the request, and then process them.


**The `Form` class**

```
from django import forms


class NewTitleForm(forms.Form):
    title = forms.CharField(label="New Title")
```
- This defines a `Form` class with a single field(title).
- I've applied a human-friendly label to the filed(New Title), which will appear in the `<label>` when it's rendered.

`views.py`
```
def create_new_page(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        title_form = NewTitleForm(request.POST)
        if title_form.is_valid():
            title = title_form.cleaned_data["title"]
            contents = request.POST.get('new-entry-contents')
            entries = util.list_entries()
            if title in entries:
                messages.error(request, f"{title} already exists in entries!")
            else:
                util.save_entry(title, contents)
                return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("encyclopedia:entry", args=[title]))

    return render(request, "encyclopedia/new-page.html", {
        "title_form": NewTitleForm()
    })
```
- A `Form` instance has an `is_valid()` method, which runs validation routines for all its field. If all fields contain valid data, it will:
  - return **True**
  - place the form's data in its **cleaned_data** attribute.
- At this view with a **GET** request, it will create an empty form instance and place it in the template context to be rendered. This is what we can expect to happen the first time we visit the URL.
- If the form is submitted using a **POST** request, the view will once again create a form instance and populate it with data from the request: title_form = NewTitleForm(request.POST) This is called “binding data to the form”
- In _new-page.html_, all the form’s fields and their attributes will be unpacked into HTML markup from that `{{ form }}` by Django’s template language.
- Now have a working web form, described by a Django **Form**, processed by a view, and rendered as an HTML `<form>`.
